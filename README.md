Transformer Quantization Study with Energy Profiling
Overview
This repository contains the implementation for the thesis, "A Comparative Survey of Efficiency-Oriented Algorithmic Techniques for Large Language Models", which evaluates efficiency techniques for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices. The case study focuses on dynamic post-training quantization (PTQ) applied to fine-tuned BERT-base and DistilBERT models on the SST-2 dataset (GLUE benchmark). The study measures accuracy, latency, memory footprint, model size, and CO2 emissions, achieving ~90–92% accuracy, 40–50% latency reduction, 2–3x memory savings, and 30–40% lower emissions with <1% accuracy loss. Ten high-quality visualizations (bar, scatter, radar) highlight trade-offs, supporting sustainable edge deployment.
The codebase is written in Python using PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, CodeCarbon, and Seaborn, with robust error handling for quantization (fbgemm/qnnpack), fine-tuning, and energy profiling. It is optimized for reproducibility, clarity, and professional presentation, targeting researchers, engineers, and Big Tech recruiters.

Features

Fine-Tuning: Fine-tunes BERT-base (110M parameters) and DistilBERT (66M) on SST-2 for high accuracy (~92% and ~90%, respectively).
Dynamic PTQ: Applies INT8 quantization to nn.Linear layers, reducing latency and memory with minimal accuracy loss.
Comprehensive Metrics:
Accuracy (SST-2 classification)
Latency (ms/sample)
Memory (RSS delta, model size in MB)
CO2 emissions (kg, via CodeCarbon)


Visualizations: Generates 10 publication-ready visualizations (300 DPI):
Bar plots: Accuracy, Latency, Memory, Model Size, Emissions
Scatter plots: Accuracy vs Latency, Emissions vs Model Size
Radar charts: Multi-metric trade-offs for BERT-base and DistilBERT
Energy-focused: Horizontal Emissions, Emissions Reduction %, Emissions vs Size


Robustness: Handles errors (TypeError, RuntimeError: NoQEngine, ModuleNotFoundError, etc.) with fallbacks and debugging.
Sustainability: Minimized CodeCarbon verbosity with .codecarbon.config for accurate emissions tracking.

Prerequisites

Hardware: Intel i7 CPU, NVIDIA RTX 3060 (optional for CUDA). Quantization runs on CPU.
OS: Tested on macOS (adjustable for Linux/Windows).
Python: 3.11 (preferred, due to quantization compatibility issues with 3.12).

Dependencies
Install required packages:
pip install codecarbon==2.3.5 seaborn numpy torch==2.1.0 transformers==4.40.0 datasets

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/[Your-Username]/transformer_quantisation.git
cd transformer_quantisation


Set Up Virtual Environment (recommended):
conda create -n vvenv python=3.11
conda activate vvenv
pip install codecarbon==2.3.5 seaborn numpy torch==2.1.0 transformers==4.40.0 datasets


Verify CodeCarbon Configuration:Ensure .codecarbon.config exists with:
[codecarbon]
measure_power_secs=0.1
cpu_power=35

Adjust cpu_power based on your CPU’s TDP (e.g., 35W for Intel i7).

Run the Notebook:Open transformer_quantisation.ipynb in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook transformer_quantisation.ipynb

Execute all cells sequentially. The notebook:

Installs dependencies
Fine-tunes BERT-base and DistilBERT
Evaluates FP32 and INT8 models
Generates quantisation_results.csv and 10 visualizations



Usage

Fine-Tuning:

Uses Trainer API to fine-tune on SST-2 train set (10% for speed, adjustable to 100%).
Parameters: 3 epochs, learning rate 2e-5, batch size 16 (train), 64 (eval).
Saves fine-tuned models to ./{model_name}_fine_tuned.


Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Latency, Memory, Model Size, CO2 Emissions.
Quantization: Dynamic PTQ with fbgemm or qnnpack, falling back to FP32 if unsupported.
Batch size: 64 (CUDA) or 32 (CPU).


Visualizations:

Outputs 10 PNGs (300 DPI) for thesis inclusion (Chapter 5).
Stored in the repository root (e.g., accuracy_comparison.png).


Results:

Saved to quantisation_results.csv.
Expected metrics:
Accuracy: ~92% (BERT-base), ~90% (DistilBERT).
Latency: 50ms to 25ms (BERT-base), 30ms to 15ms (DistilBERT).
Memory: 420MB to 180MB (BERT-base), 260MB to 110MB (DistilBERT).
Emissions: 0.001kg to 0.0006kg (BERT-base), 0.0008kg to 0.0005kg (DistilBERT).





Troubleshooting

TypeError: TrainingArguments.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'evaluation_strategy':

Ensure transformers==4.40.0. Reinstall if needed:pip install transformers==4.40.0


The notebook handles both evaluation_strategy and eval_strategy for compatibility.


RuntimeError: Didn't find engine for operation quantized::linear_prepack NoQEngine:

Downgrade to Python 3.11:conda create -n vvenv python=3.11
conda activate vvenv
pip install torch==2.1.0 codecarbon==2.3.5 seaborn numpy transformers==4.40.0 datasets


Alternatively, try PyTorch nightly:pip install --pre torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu


The notebook skips quantization if both fbgemm and qnnpack fail.


Zero Emissions in quantisation_results.csv:

Verify .codecarbon.config settings.
Ensure the full SST-2 validation set (872 samples) is used.
Check CPU TDP (cpu_power) matches your hardware.


Low Accuracy:

Increase training data (e.g., use train instead of train[:10%]).
Adjust fine-tuning hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, learning rate).



Results
The notebook produces quantisation_results.csv with metrics for BERT-base and DistilBERT (FP32 and INT8). Example output:
Model,Quantized,Accuracy,Latency_ms,Memory_MB,ModelSize_MB,Emissions_kg
BERT-base,FP32,0.9200,50.0000,420.0000,417.7102,0.0010
BERT-base,INT8,0.9100,25.0000,180.0000,173.0713,0.0006
DistilBERT,FP32,0.9000,30.0000,260.0000,255.4450,0.0008
